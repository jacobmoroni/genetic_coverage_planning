abstract = {The variable-structure multiple-model particle filtering approach for state estimation of road-constrained targets is addressed. The multiple models are designed to account for target maneuvers including "move-stop-move" and motion ambiguity at an intersection; the time-varying active model sets are adaptively selected based on target state and local terrain condition. The hybrid state space is partitioned into the mode subspace and the target subspace. The mode state is estimated based on random sampling; the target state as well as the relevant likelihood function associated with a mode sample sequence is approximated as Gaussian distribution, of which the conditional mean and covariance are deterministically computed using a nonlinear Kalman filter which accounts for road constraints in its update. The importance function for the sampling of the mode state approximates the optimal importance function under the same Gaussian assumption of the target state.},

abstract = {Recently Rao-Blackwellized particle filters have been introduced as effective means to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. This approach uses a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key question is how to reduce the number of particles. In this paper we present adaptive techniques to reduce the number of particles in a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter for learning grid maps. We propose an approach to compute an accurate proposal distribution taking into account not only the movement of the robot but also the most recent observation. This drastically decrease the uncertainty about the robot's pose in the prediction step of the filter. Furthermore, we present an approach to selectively carry out re-sampling operations which seriously reduces the problem of particle depletion. Experimental results carried out with mobile robots in large-scale indoor as well as in outdoor environments illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous approaches.},

@article{Reid1979,
abstract = {An algorithm for tracking multiple targets in a cluttered environment is developed. The algorithm is capable of initiating tracks, accounting for false or missing reports, and processing sets of dependent reports. As each measurement is received, probabilities are calculated for the hypotheses that the measurement came from previously known targets in a target file, or from a new target, or that the measurement is false. Target states are estimated from each such data-association hypothesis, using a Kalman filter. As more measurements are received, the probabilities of joint hypotheses are calculated recursively using all available information such as density of unknown targets, density of false targets, probability of detection, and location uncertainty. This branching technique allows correlation of a measurement with its source based on subsequent, as well as previous, data. To keep the number of hypotheses reasonable, unlikely hypotheses are eliminated and hypotheses with similar target estimates are combined. To minimize computational requirements, the entire set of targets and measurements is divided into clusters that are solved independently. In an illustrative example of aircraft tracking, the algorithm successfully tracks targets over a wide range of conditions.},

Gaining insight into the movement and behaviors of shoppers is of high interest for marketing, merchandizing, store operations and data mining. Of particular interest is the process of purchase decision making. What catches a customers attention? What products go unnoticed? What does a customer look at before making a final decision? Towards this goal we presents a system that detects and tracks both the location and gaze of shoppers in retail environments. While networks of standard overhead store cameras are used for tracking the location of customers, small in-shelf cameras are used for estimating customer gaze. The presented system operates robustly in real-time and can be deployed in a variety of retail applications.},

In this paper, we introduce a new formulation, based on the mathematical concept of random finite sets, that allows for tracking an unknown and dynamic number of mobile targets with a team of robots. We show how to employ the Probability Hypothesis Density filter to simultaneously estimate the number of targets and their positions. Next, we present a greedy algo- rithm for assigning trajectories to the robots that maximize submodular objective functions and prove that this is a 2-approximation. We examine two such objective functions: the mutual information between the estimated target positions and future measurements from the robots, and the expected number of targets detected by the robot team. We provide extensive simulation evaluations using a real-world dataset.},

abstract = {Increasingly, for many application areas, it is becoming important to include elements of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity in order to model accurately the underlying dynamics of a physical system. Moreover, it is typically crucial to process data on-line as it arrives, both from the point of view of storage costs as well as for rapid adaptation to changing signal characteristics. In this paper, we review both optimal and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for nonlinear/non-Gaussian tracking problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle") representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as SIR, ASIR, and RPF are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential importance sampling (SIS) algorithm. These are discussed and compared with the standard EKF through an illustrative example},

@misc{Shannon1948,
abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

The probability density function (PDF) for each individual target location is accurately maintained by an independent instance of a general Bayesian filter. The team utility for the search vehicles trajectories is given by the sum of the `cumulative' probability of detection for each target. A dual-objective switching function is also introduced to direct the search towards the mode of the nearest target PDF when the utility becomes too low in a region to distinguish between trajectories. Simulation results for both clustered and isolated targets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed search strategy for multiple targets.},

abstract = {The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is a multiple-target filter for recursively estimating the number of targets and their state vectors from sets of observations. The filter is able to operate in environments with false alarms and missed detections. Two distinct algorithmic implementations of this technique have been developed. The first of which, called the Particle PHD filter, requires clustering techniques to provide target state estimates which can lead to inaccurate estimates and is computationally expensive. The second algorithm, called the Gaussian Mixture PHD (GM-PHD) filter does not require clustering algorithms but is restricted to linear-Gaussian target dynamics, since it uses the Kalman filter to estimate the means and covariances of the Gaussians. Extensions for the GM-PHD filter allow for mildly non-linear dynamics using extended and Unscented Kalman filters. A new particle implementation of the PHD filter which does not require clustering to determine target states is presented here. The PHD is approximated by a mixture of Gaussians, as in the GM-PHD filter but the transition density and likelihood function can be non-linear. The resulting filter no longer has a closed form solution so Monte Carlo integration is applied for approximating the prediction and update distributions. This is calculated using a bank of Gaussian particle filters, similar to the procedure used with the Gaussian sum particle filter. The new algorithm is derived here and presented with simulated results.},

abstract = {Particle filters (PFs) are powerful sampling-based inference/learning algorithms for dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). They allow us to treat, in a principled way, any type of probability distribution, nonlinearity and non-stationarity. They have appeared in several fields under such names as “condensation”, “sequential Monte Carlo” and “survival of the fittest”. In this paper, we show how we can exploit the structure of the DBN to increase the efficiency of particle filtering, using a technique known as Rao-Blackwellisation. Essentially, this samples some of the variables, and marginalizes out the rest exactly, using the Kalman filter, HMM filter, junction tree algorithm, or any other finite dimensional optimal filter. We show that Rao-Blackwellised particle filters (RBPFs) lead to more accurate estimates than standard PFs. We demonstrate RBPFs on two problems, namely non-stationary online regression with radial basis function networks and robot localization and map building. We also discuss other potential application areas and provide references to some Þnite dimensional optimal filters.},
