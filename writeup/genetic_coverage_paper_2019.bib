@techreport{Choset2001,
abstract = {This paper surveys recent results in coverage path planning, a new path planning approach that determines a path for a robot to pass over all points in its free space. Unlike conventional point-to-point path planning, coverage path planning enables applications such as robotic de-mining, snow removal, lawn mowing, car-body painting, machine milling, etc. This paper will focus on coverage path planning algorithms for mobile robots constrained to operate in the plane. These algorithms can be classified as either heuristic or complete. It is our conjecture that most complete algorithms use an exact cellular decomposition, either explicitly or implicitly, to achieve coverage. Therefore, this paper organizes the coverage algorithms into four categories: heuristic, approximate, partial-approximate and exact cellular decompo-sitions. The final section describes some provably complete multi-robot coverage algorithms.},
annote = {Survey of different types of coverage planning and the definition of it

Important notes. 

Talks about cellular decomposition (Breaking down the space to cells to compute coverage of the space)

Talks about benefits of randomized search

all addressed full coverage and optimizes only the path length, or turning cost

doesnt talk about loop closures in path, more looking only to see everything once (would not work well with slam and mapping)},

@article{Bircher2016,
abstract = {This paper presents a new algorithm for three-dimensional coverage path planning for autonomous structural inspection operations using aerial robots. The proposed approach is capable of computing short inspection paths via an alternating two-step optimization algorithm according to which at every iteration it attempts to find a new and improved set of viewpoints that together provide full coverage with decreased path cost. The algorithm supports the integration of multiple sensors with different fields of view, the limitations of which are respected. Both fixed-wing as well as rotorcraft aerial robot configurations are supported and their motion constraints are respected at all optimization steps, while the algorithm operates on both mesh-and occupancy map-based representations of the environment. To thoroughly evaluate this new path planning strategy, a set of B Kostas Alexis large-scale simulation scenarios was considered, followed by multiple real-life experimental test-cases using both vehicle configurations.},

@article{Sipahioglu2010,
abstract = {Multi-robot sensor-based coverage path planning requires every point given in the workspace has to be covered at least by a sensor of a robot in the robot team. In this study, a novel algorithm was proposed for the sensor-based coverage of narrow environments by considering energy capacities of the robots. For this purpose, the environment was modeled by a Generalized Voronoi diagram-based graph to guarantee complete sensor-based coverage. Then, depending on the required arc set, a complete coverage route was created by using the Chinese Postman Problem or the Rural Postman Problem, and this route was partitioned among robots by considering energy capacities. Route partitioning was realized by modifying the Ulusoy partitioning algorithm which has polynomial complexity. This modification handles two different energy consumptions of mobile robots during sensor-based coverage, which was not considered before. The developed algorithm was coded in C++ and implemented on P3-DX mobile robots both in laboratory and in MobileSim simulation environments. It was shown that the convenient routes for energy constrained multi-robots could be generated by using the proposed algorithm in less than 1 s.},
